## Project Context
**Project:** "Tiny Fish Catch" - Mobile-First HTML5 Canvas Game for WooCommerce
**Target:** Fish store website "Ryby u Tadeusza"
**Primary Users:** Mobile phone users (80%+ traffic expected)
**Integration:** WordPress/WooCommerce shortcode system
**Performance Target:** <50KB total, 60fps on mobile, <3s load time

## Development Philosophy
**Test-First Development:** Write tests before implementation
**Mobile-First:** Every feature must work perfectly on mobile before desktop
**Performance-First:** Optimize for low-end mobile devices
**Accessibility-First:** Support screen readers and keyboard navigation

- **Puppeteer** - E2E testing and mobile device simulation
- **Canvas Testing Library** - Canvas-specific testing utilities
- **Performance Testing** - Lighthouse CI integration

### Development Tools
- **Webpack** - Module bundling and optimization
- **Babel** - ES6+ transpilation
- **ESLint** - Code quality
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Canvas 2D Context** - Game graphics

## Code Implementation Guidelines

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment needed, never `var`
- Use arrow functions: `const handleTouchStart = (event) => {}`
- Use destructuring: `const { x, y } = touch.coordinates`
- Use template literals: `score: ${currentScore}` instead of concatenation
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use meaningful variable names: `fishCaughtCount` not `fc`
- Event handlers should have "handle" prefix: `handleTouchMove`, `handleCanvasClick`

### Mobile Touch Optimization
- Always prevent default touch behaviors: `event.preventDefault()`
- Use `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend` instead of click events
- Implement touch zones minimum 44px (Apple guidelines)
- Use `passive: false` for touch events that need preventDefault
- Optimize for one-handed use (thumb reach zones)
- Support both portrait and landscape orientations

### Canvas Best Practices
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation
- Implement object pooling for fish sprites to avoid garbage collection
- Use efficient drawing methods: `drawImage` over `arc` and `fill`
- Clear canvas efficiently: `clearRect` only necessary areas
- Use off-screen canvas for complex sprites
- Implement viewport culling (don't draw off-screen objects)

### Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load all non-critical assets
- Use WebP images with fallbacks
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Use CSS transforms over changing position properties
- Implement efficient collision detection (spatial partitioning)
- Profile with Chrome DevTools regularly

### Testing Requirements (Test-First Development)
```javascript
// Example test structure - write BEFORE implementation
describe('FishGame', () => {
  describe('Touch Controls', () => {
    it('should cast fishing line on tap', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should move hook left/right on drag', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Game Mechanics', () => {
    it('should catch fish when hook touches fish sprite', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should update score when fish is caught', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Mobile Performance', () => {
    it('should maintain 60fps on low-end devices', () => {
      // Performance test
    });
    
    it('should load under 3 seconds on 3G', () => {
      // Load time test
    });
  });
});
```

```

### CSS Guidelines
- Mobile-first responsive design: start with mobile, enhance for desktop
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming: `var(--primary-color)`
- Use `rem` units for scalability
- Implement proper focus styles for accessibility
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Optimize for touch targets (minimum 44px)

### Accessibility Requirements
- Implement ARIA labels for game elements
- Support keyboard navigation as fallback
- Provide audio descriptions for visual elements
- Support high contrast mode
- Implement focus management
- Provide alternative text for game graphics

### WooCommerce Integration Standards
- Create clean shortcode: `[tiny_fish_catch]`
- Support WordPress hooks and filters
- Implement proper enqueueing of scripts and styles
- Support WordPress caching plugins
- Follow WordPress coding standards
- Implement proper error handling for WordPress environment

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Proper error messages for users
- Fallback for Canvas API failures
- Network error handling for asset loading
- Touch API fallbacks for older browsers

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize any user inputs (high scores, names)
- Validate data before sending to WordPress
- Implement rate limiting for score submissions
- Use nonces for WordPress AJAX requests
- Prevent XSS vulnerabilities in dynamic content

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Prettier for automated formatting
- JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Maximum function length: 20 lines
- Maximum file length: 200 lines
- Cyclomatic complexity: maximum 10
- Test coverage: minimum 80%

### Performance Metrics
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Frame rate: stable 60fps on mobile
- Memory usage: <50MB on low-end devices

### Browser Support
- **Primary:** Chrome/Safari Mobile (iOS 12+, Android 8+)
- **Secondary:** Desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Fallback:** Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core game works without JavaScript

### Development Workflow
1. **Red:** Write failing test
2. **Green:** Write minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor:** Improve code while keeping tests passing
4. **Performance:** Profile and optimize
5. **Review:** Code review and mobile testing
6. **Deploy:** Test in WordPress environment

This project prioritizes mobile experience, performance, and testability above all else. Every decision should be evaluated against these criteria.
